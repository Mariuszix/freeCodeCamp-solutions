        <h2 id="headline">Here is some information about Sadhguru:</h2>
        <p>Sadhguru is a yogi and visionary. Named one of India’s 50 most influential
            people, Sadhguru’s work has touched the lives of millions worldwide
            through his transformational programs. Sadhguru has a unique ability
            to make the ancient yogic sciences relevant to contemporary minds. His
            approach does not ascribe to any belief system, but offers methods for selftransformation that are both proven and powerful.</p>
        <p>Dedicated to the physical, mental and spiritual wellbeing of humanity and
            gifted with utter clarity of perception, Sadhguru possesses a perspective on
            life and living that never fails to intrigue, challenge and surprise all those he
            encounters.</p>
        <p>Sadhguru has also initiated several projects for social revitalization,
            education and the environment through which millions of people have
            been given the means to overcome poverty, improve their quality of life
            and achieve community-based, sustainable development. In the fall of
            2017, Sadhguru initiated Rally For Rivers, a nationwide campaign aiming to
            implement sustainable and long-term policy changes to revitalize India’s
            severely depleted rivers, which found great support among India’s people
            and leadership.</p>
        <p><strong>Action for Rural Rejuvenation</strong> 
            is a project that provides medical care and community rehabilitation covering more than 7 million
            people in 4,600 villages in Southern India.
            Part of Action for Rural Rejuvenation, Isha Gramotsavam is a yearly festival,
            celebrating village life by showcasing the essence of rural Tamil Nadu
            through an elaborate display of rural games, art, drama, dance, music
            and food specialties. The event highlights the role of sports in rural life by
            featuring the final rounds of a state-wide inter-village sports tournament.</p>
        <p><strong>Project GreenHands</strong>
           is a massive public reforestation effort started in South India with over 33 million
            trees planted to date.</p>
            <p><strong>Rally for Rivers</strong> is a nation-wide campaign that Sadhguru has
                launched to create awareness about the state of India’s rivers
                and urge the government to implement a positive river policy.
                The Rally proposes tree plantation on riversides as a means to
                increase river flow. To garner public support for the cause, in
                September 2017, Sadhguru drove himself from Kanyakumari to
                the Himalayas. Over 162 million people pledged their support
                making it a landmark people’s movement in post-independence
                India. The draft policy recommendation was presented to Prime
                Minister Narendra Modi in October 2017</p>
